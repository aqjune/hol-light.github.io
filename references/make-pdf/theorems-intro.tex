\chapter{Pre-proved Theorems}

The sections that follow list the most useful theorems built into the
\HOL\ Light system, which are proved and bound to \ML\ identifiers when the
system is built. Some theorems that were felt (subjectively) unlikely to be
useful for most HOL Light users are omitted. Within the broad groupings,
theorems are listed in alphabetical order, by the name of the OCaml identifier
to which they are bound.
