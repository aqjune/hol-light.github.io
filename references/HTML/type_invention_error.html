<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Determines if invented type variables are treated as an error.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
If HOL Light is unable to assign specific types to a term entered in quotation,
it will invent its own type variables to use in the most general type. The flag
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>type_invention_error</SPAN> determines whether in such cases the term parser treats
it as an error. The default is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>false</SPAN>, since sometimes the invention of type
variables is immaterial, e.g. in ad-hoc logical lemmas used inside a proof.
However, to enforce a more careful style, set it to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>true</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Not applicable.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
When the following term is entered, HOL Light invents a type variable to use as
the most general type. In the normal course of events this merely results in a
warning (see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>type_invention_warning</SPAN> to remove even this warning):
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let tm = `x = x`;;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val tm : term = `x = x`
</PRE></DIV>
whereas if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>type_invention_error</SPAN> is set to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>true</SPAN>, the term parser
fails with an error message:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # type_invention_error := true;;
  val it : unit = ()
  # let tm = `x = x`;;
  Exception:
  Failure "typechecking error (cannot infer type of variables): =, x".
</PRE></DIV>
You can avoid the error by explicitly giving appropriate types or
type variables yourself:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let tm = `(x:int) = x`;;
  val tm : term = `x = x`
</PRE></DIV>
