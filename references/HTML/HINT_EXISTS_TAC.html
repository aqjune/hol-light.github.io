<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Attemps to instantiate existential goals from context.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a goal which contains some subformula of the form
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>?x_1... x_k. P_1 y^1_1 ... y^1_m1 /\ ... /\ P_n y^n_1 ... y^n_mn</SPAN> in a
context where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>P_i t_1 ... t_mi</SPAN> holds for some <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t_1,...,t_mi</SPAN>, then
instantiates <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x_i1,...,x_i_mi</SPAN> with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t_1,...,t_mi</SPAN>. The ``context'' consists in
the assumptions or in the premisses of the implications where the existential
subformula occurs.

Note: it is enough that just P t holds, not the complete existentially
quantified formula. As the name suggests, we just use the context as a ``hint''
but it is (in most general uses) not sufficient to solve the existential
completely: if this is doable automatically, then other techniques can do the
job in a better way (typically <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON</SPAN>).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if no instantiation is found from the context.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!P Q R S. P 1 /\ Q 2 /\ R 3 ==> ?x y. P x /\ R y /\ S x y`;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!P Q R S. P 1 /\ Q 2 /\ R 3 ==> (?x y. P x /\ R y /\ S x y)`

  # e HINT_EXISTS_TAC;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!P Q R S. P 1 /\ Q 2 /\ R 3 ==> S 1 3`

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
When facing an existential goal, it happens often that the context ``suggests''
a candidate to be a witness. In many cases, this is because the existential
goal is partly satisfied by a proposition in the context. However, often, the
context does not allow to automatically prove completely the existential using
this witness. Therefore, usual automation tactics are useless. Usually, in such
circumstances, one has to provide the witness explicitly. This is tedious and
time-consuming whereas this witness can be found automatically from the
context, this is what this tactic allows to do.
