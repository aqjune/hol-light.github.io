<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>CLAIM_TAC : string -&gt; term -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Breaks down and labels an intermediate claim in a proof.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a Boolean term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> and a string <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s</SPAN> of the form expected by
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DESTRUCT_TAC</SPAN> indicating how to break down and label that assertion,
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CLAIM_TAC s t</SPAN> breaks the current goal into two or more subgoals. One of
these is to establish <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> using the current context and the others are to
establish the original goal with the broken-down form of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> as additional
assumptions.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the term is not Boolean or the pattern is ill-formed or does not match
the form of the theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here we show how we can attack a propositional goal (admittedly trivial with
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>TAUT</SPAN>).
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `(p <=> q) ==> p \/ ~q`;;

  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `(p <=> q) ==> p \/ ~q`

  # e DISCH_TAC;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

    0 [`p <=> q`]

  `p \/ ~q`
</PRE></DIV>

We establish the intermediate goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p /\ q \/ ~p /\ ~q</SPAN>, the disjunction being
in turn broken down into two labelled hypotheses <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>yes</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>no</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(CLAIM_TAC "yes|no" `p /\ q \/ ~p /\ ~q`);;
  val it : goalstack = 3 subgoals (3 total)

    0 [`p <=> q`]
    1 [`~p /\ ~q`] (no)

  `p \/ ~q`

    0 [`p <=> q`]
    1 [`p /\ q`] (yes)

  `p \/ ~q`

    0 [`p <=> q`]

  `p /\ q \/ ~p /\ ~q`
</PRE></DIV>
