<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>SEQ_IMP_REWRITE_TAC : thm list -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Performs sequential implicational rewriting, adding new assumptions if
necessary.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
This tactic is closely related to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> but uses the provided
theorems sequentially instead of simultaneously: given a list of theorems
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>[th_1;...;th_k]</SPAN>, the tactic call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SEQ_IMP_REWRITE_TAC [th_1;...;th_k]</SPAN>
applies as many implicational rewriting as it can with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th_1</SPAN>, then with
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th_2</SPAN>, etc. When <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th_k</SPAN> is reached, start over from <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th_1</SPAN>. Repeat till no
more rewrite can be achieved.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if no rewrite can be achieved. If the usual behavior of leaving the goal unchanged
is desired, one can wrap the coal in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>TRY_TAC</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
This uses the basic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!a b c. a < b ==> (a - b) / (a - b) * c = c`;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!a b c. a < b ==> (a - b) / (a - b) * c = c`

  # e(IMP_REWRITE_TAC[REAL_DIV_REFL;REAL_MUL_LID;REAL_SUB_0; REAL_LT_IMP_NE]);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!a b. ~(a < b)`
</PRE></DIV>
But with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SEQ_IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, the same sequence of theorems solves the goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(SEQ_IMP_REWRITE_TAC[REAL_DIV_REFL;REAL_MUL_LID;REAL_SUB_0; REAL_LT_IMP_NE]);;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This addresses a problem which happens already with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> or
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SIMP_TAC</SPAN>: one generally rewrites with one theorem, then with another, etc.
and, in the end, once every step is done, (s)he packs everything in a list and
provides this list to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>; but it then happens that some
surprises happen at this point because the simultaneous use of all theorems
does not yield the same result as their subsequent use. A usual solution is
simply to decompose the call into two calls by identifying manually which
theorems are the source of the unexpected behavior when used together. Or one
can simply use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SEQ_IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>. Note that this is however a lot slower
than <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>. The user may prefer to first use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> and
if it does not work like the sequential use of single implicational rewrites
then use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SEQ_IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>.
