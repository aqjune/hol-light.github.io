<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Automated first-order proof search tactic using Metis algorithm.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
A call to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>METIS_TAC[theorems]</SPAN> will attempt to establish the current goal
using pure first-order reasoning, taking <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>theorems</SPAN> as the starting-point. (It
does not take the assumptions of the goal into account, but the similar
function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_METIS_TAC</SPAN> does.) It will usually either solve the goal
completely or run for an infeasibly long time, but it may sometimes fail
quickly.

This tactic is closely related to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN>, and many of the same general
comments apply. Generally speaking, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>METIS_TAC</SPAN> is capable of solving more
challenging problems than <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN>, though the latter is often faster where
it succeeds. Like <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN>, it will exploit no special properties of the
constants in the goal, other than equality and logical primitives. Any
properties that are needed must be supplied explicitly in the theorem list,
e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>LE_REFL</SPAN> to tell it that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT><=</SPAN> on natural numbers is reflexive, or
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_ADD_SYM</SPAN> to tell it that addition on real numbers is symmetric.

Sometimes the similar <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN> tactic is faster, especially on simpler
goals.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the goal is unprovable within the search bounds.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here is a simple `group theory' type property about a binary function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>m</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `(!x y z. m(x, m(y,z)) = m(m(x,y), z) /\ m(x,y) = m(y,x))
       ==> m(a, m(b, m(c, m(d, m(e, f))))) = m(f, m(e, m(d, m(c, m(b, a)))))`;;

</PRE></DIV>
It is solved in a fraction of a second by:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(METIS_TAC[]);;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>
This is an example where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>METIS_TAC</SPAN> substantially outperforms <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN>,
which does not seem to be able to solve that problem in a reasonable time.
