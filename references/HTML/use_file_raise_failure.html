<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Flag determining whether unsuccessful loading of an OCaml file must raise
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Failure</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The reference variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>use_file_raise_failure</SPAN> is used by the function
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>use_file</SPAN> to determine whether an unsuccessful loading of a source file must
raise <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Failure</SPAN> or simply print an error message on the screen.
The default value is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>false</SPAN>.
The behavior of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>loads</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>loadt</SPAN> are also affected by this flag because they
internally invoke <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>use_file</SPAN>.

If this flag is set to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>true</SPAN>, recursive loading will immediately fail after any
unsuccessful loading of a source file.
This is helpful for pinpointing the failing location from loading multiple source
files.
On the other hand, this will cause Toplevel forget all OCaml bindings
(`<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>let .. = ..;;</SPAN>') that have been made during the load before the erroneous point,
leading to a state whose OCaml definitions and constant definitions in HOL Light
are inconsistent.

If this flag is set to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>false</SPAN>, unsuccessful loading will simply print a error
message and continue to the next statement.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Not applicable.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Consider <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a.ml</SPAN> that has the following text:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   loadt "b.ml";;
   print_endline "b.ml loaded";;
</PRE></DIV>
and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>b.ml</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   undefined_var := 3;; (* Raises a failure *)
</PRE></DIV>

If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>use_file_raise_failure</SPAN> is set to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>false</SPAN> (which is default), the message
in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a.ml</SPAN> is printed even if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>b.ml</SPAN> fails.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   # loadt "a.ml";;
   File "/home/ubuntu/hol-light-aqjune/b.ml", line 1, characters 0-13:
                              1 | undefined_var := 3;; (* Raises a failure *)
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                              Error: Unbound value undefined_var
   Error in included file /home/ubuntu/hol-light-aqjune/b.ml
   - : unit = ()
   b.ml loaded
   - : unit = ()
   val it : unit = ()
</PRE></DIV>
However, if it is set to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>true</SPAN>, the message is not printed because loading
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a.ml</SPAN> also fails immediately after loading <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>b.ml</SPAN>.
Also, the stack trace is printed because the failure reaches to the top level.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   # use_file_raise_failure := true;;
   val it : unit = ()
   # loadt "a.ml";;
   File "/home/ubuntu/hol-light-aqjune/b.ml", line 1, characters 0-13:
   1 | undefined_var := 3;; (* Raises a failure *)
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Error: Unbound value undefined_var
   Exception:
   Failure "Error in included file /home/ubuntu/hol-light-aqjune/b.ml".
   Exception:
   Failure "Error in included file /home/ubuntu/hol-light-aqjune/a.ml".
</PRE></DIV>
