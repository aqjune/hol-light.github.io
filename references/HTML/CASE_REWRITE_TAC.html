<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>CASE_REWRITE_TAC : thm -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Performs casewise rewriting.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Same usage as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> but applies case rewriting instead of
implicational rewriting, i.e. given a theorem of the form
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>!x_1... x_n. P ==> !y_1... y_m. l = r</SPAN> and a goal with an atom <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN> containing
a subterm matching <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>l</SPAN>, turns the atom into <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(P' ==> A') /\ (~P' ==> A)</SPAN> where
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A'</SPAN> is the atom in which the matching subterm of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>l</SPAN> is rewritten, and where
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>P'</SPAN> is the instantiation of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>P</SPAN> so that the rewrite is valid. Note that this
tactic takes only one theorem since in practice there is seldom a need to
apply it subsequently with several theorems.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if no subterm matching <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>l</SPAN> occurs in the goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g ‘!a b c. a < b ==> (a - b) / (a - b) * c = c‘;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  ‘!a b c. a < b ==> (a - b) / (a - b) * c = c‘

  # e(CASE_REWRITE_TAC REAL_DIV_REFL);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  ‘!a b c.
    a < b
      ==> (~(a - b = &amp;0) ==> &amp;1 * c = c) /\
        (a - b = &amp;0 ==> (a - b) / (a - b) * c = c)‘
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Similar to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, but instead of assuming that a precondition
holds, one just wants to make a distinction between the case where this
precondition holds, and the one where it does not.
