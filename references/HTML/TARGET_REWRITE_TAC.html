<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Performs target implicational rewriting.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> (the ``support theorem''), and another theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>uh</SPAN> (the
``target theorem''), target rewriting generates all the goals that can be
obtained by rewriting with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>, until it becomes possible to rewrite with
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>uh</SPAN>. Contrarily to standard rewriting techniques, only one position is
rewritten at a time (<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SIMP_TAC</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, or even
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> apply rewriting to several parallel positions if
applicable). Therefore only the rewrites that are useful for the application
of the theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>uh</SPAN> are achieved in the end. More precisely, given a list of
theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>[th_1;...;th_k]</SPAN> of the form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>!x_1... x_n. P ==> !y_1... y_m. l = r</SPAN>,
and a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>uh</SPAN> of the form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>!x_1... x_n. Q ==> !y_1... y_m. l' = r'</SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>TARGET_REWRITE_TAC [th_1;...;th_k] uh</SPAN> applies target implicational rewriting,
i.e. tries all the possible implicational rewrites with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th_1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th_k</SPAN>
until it obtains a goal where implicational rewrite with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>uh</SPAN> becomes possible.

To understand better the difference with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> and the need for a
target theorem, consider a goal g where more than one subterm can be rewritten
using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>: with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, all such subterms are rewritten simultaneously;
whereas, with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>TARGET_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, every of these subterms are rewritten
independently, thus yielding as many goals. If one of these goals can be
rewritten (in one position or more) by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>uh</SPAN>, then the tactic returns this goal.
Otherwise, the ``one-subterm rewriting'' is applied again on every of the new
goals, iteratively until a goal which can be rewritten by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>uh</SPAN> is obtained.


<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if no rewrite can be achieved using the support theorems.
It may also fail if no path is found to apply the target theorem,
but, most of the time, it does not terminate in this situation.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
This is a simple example:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REAL_ADD_RINV;;
  val it : thm = |- !x. x + --x = &amp;0
  # g `!x y z. --y + x + y = &amp;0`;;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!x y z. --y + x + y = &amp;0`

  # e(TARGET_REWRITE_TAC[REAL_ADD_AC] REAL_ADD_RINV);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!x. x + &amp;0 = &amp;0`
</PRE></DIV>
And a slightly more complex one:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REAL_MUL_RINV;;
  val it : thm = |- !x. ~(x = &amp;0) ==> x * inv x = &amp;1
  # g `!x y. inv y * x * y = x`;;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!x y z. inv y * x * y = x`

  # e(TARGET_REWRITE_TAC[REAL_MUL_AC] REAL_MUL_RINV);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!x y. x * &amp;1 = x / ~(y = &amp;0)`
</PRE></DIV>
Let us finally consider an example which does not involve associativity and
commutativity. Consider the following goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!z. norm (cnj z) = norm z`;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!z. norm (cnj z) = norm z`
</PRE></DIV>
A preliminary step here is to decompose the left-side z into its polar
coordinates. This can be done by applying the following theorem:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # ARG;;
  val it : thm =
  |- !z. &amp;0 <= Arg z /\ Arg z < &amp;2 * pi /\ z = Cx (norm z) * cexp (ii * Cx (Arg z))
</PRE></DIV>
But using standard rewriting would rewrite both sides and would not terminate
(or actually, in the current implementation of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, simply would not
apply). Instead we can use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>TARGET_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> by noting that we actually plan
to decompose into polar coordinates with the intention of using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CNJ_MUL</SPAN>
afterwards, which yields:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(TARGET_REWRITE_TAC[ARG] CNJ_MUL);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!z. norm (cnj (Cx (norm z)) * cnj (cexp (ii * Cx (Arg z)))) = norm z`
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This tactic is useful each time someone does not want to rewrite a theorem
everywhere or if a rewriting diverges. Therefore, it can replace most calls to
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>: most of the time, these tactics are
used to control rewriting more precisely than <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>. However, their use
is tedious and time-consuming whereas the corresponding reasoning is not
complex. In addition, even when the user manages to come out with a working
tactic, this tactic is generally very fragile. Instead, with
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>TARGET_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, the user does not have to think about the low-level
control of rewriting but just gives the theorem which corresponds to the next
step in the proof (see examples): this is extremely simple and fast to devise.
Note in addition that, contrarily to an explicit (and therefore fragile) path,
the target theorem represents a reasoning step which has few chances to change
in further refinements of the script.

When using associativity-commutativity theorems as support theorems, this
tactic allows to achieve AC-rewriting.
